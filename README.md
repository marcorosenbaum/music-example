# music-example

This project is built using Vue.js, Firebase, Tailwind and some other packages like Pinia, Vue-Router , Vue-i18n, Vee-Validate, Howler.

It's an example for a music website where you can upload and listen to songs.

I built this project as part of the online course "Complete Vue Developer Bootcamp (Pinia, Vitest)
" by Zero to Mastery.
